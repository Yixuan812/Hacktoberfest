## Elements, Compunds and Mixtures + Solutions and Suspensions
### Elements
Elements are categorised in the Periodic Table, where they are arranged according to increasing atomic number.
#### The Periodic Table
The Periodic Table consists of alkaline earth metals, transition metals, noble gases (monatomic, least reactive).
### Compounds
Compunds are made up of two or more elements. A compound does not have the properties of its constituent elements, and the proportion of the elements are the same throughout the material. For example, carbon dioxide is a compund of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.
### Mixtures
Mixtures are made up compounds or elements that are mixed together, but not chemically bonded. It has the properties of the atoms it is made up of, and does not have a fixed proportion throughout the mixture. An example will be air, which is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, neon, water vapour and many other gases.
